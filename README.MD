- **1/3 Supply**
    - **Magic farm**
        - 24/9 - 7/10
        - Emissions for staked:
            - Loot
            - N
            - Agld
            - Treasure (fractionalised)
        - Projected supply end of farm: ~100-110m
- **2/3 Supply**
    - Emissions - Emitted on asymptotic curve similar to BTC halvening, but occuring every year
    - Treasure mines (LP / Staking 60%) -
    - Ecosystem fund (30%)
    - Team development (10%) - is this treasury and/or incentives for team?
- Proposed
    - Mining - 25%
        - PoW - legions + treasure to mine
        - Is there a way to adjust difficulty rating as mine depletes?
        - Each mine is made up of:
            - [x] blocks
            - each block contains [x] magic
            - blocks take on average [2 hours] to mine at 1x speed
        - Rate of mining (assuming no modifiers)
            - Common - 0.5x
            - Uncommon - 0.75x
            - Rare - 1.25x
            - Legendary - 1.5x
    - Staking / liquidity - 10%
    - Ecosystem fund - 20%
    - Team - 10% of treasure farm and mining

**veMAGIC / LP**

- Objective
    - Incentivise and reward long-term holding and active participation in the Treasure ecosystem
    - Embed game theoretic design to drive collective / group outcomes
- Overview
    - veMAGIC and veMAGIC LP are the special access [keys] within the Treasure ecosystem ('keys to the Citadel')
    - 've' MAGIC / LPs are transmuted through time (PoW) and sacrifices to the gods (treasures)
    - Holders are granted modifiers
- Breaking Transmutation
    - Holders may break their transmutation from 've' back to MAGIC at a cost relative to the time remaining in their lock (or some other mechanism)
        - [x%] of MAGIC cost from breaking transmutations are [burnt], [x%] gifted to remaining veMAGIC holders (reward the strong minded)
    - Transmutation back to MAGIC has 24h delay
- Collective outcomes (3,3 | -3,-3)
    - veMAGIC and veMAGIC LP are impacted by the 'Collective Wealth' and 'Tragedy of the Commons' (ie. lettuce hands) group modifiers
    - Collective Wealth (3,3)
        - average veMAGIC as % of total MAGIC vs thresholds across [x epochs] are grants access to (options):
            - higher tier of boost
            - special items
        - Full season (or x epochs) of consecutive max tier threshold met unlocks mythical items
    - Tragedy of the Commons (-3,-3)
        - If net veMAGIC movements are negative over [x] epochs, all veMAGIC modifers are reduced by [x] for [x] epochs
        - +MAGIC and ulMAGIC holders immune
        
- Mechanics
    - **Rewarding treasure holders**
        - each treasure worth x points based on rarity
        - x total points of treasure and % of veMAGIC required for GENESIS event; powering on the genesis mine
        - 5% of all mine yield goes to treasure stakers
        - the 5% distributed based on relative points v total (passive incoom + rewards holders of rarer treasure)
        - when staked veMAGIC reaches thresholds of circ supply, it unlocks additional capacity for the mine (eg. 25% ve staked = +10% capacity)
        - genesis mine will have very attractive APR
        - this creates demand for treasure secondary to 1) turn on mine & 2) share of incooom which scales with legion productivity and capacity increases (ve staked)
        - creates demand for veMAGIC locking to 1) turn on mine 2) unlock greater mine capacity
    - **Transition to L2**
        - aMAGIC
            - Objectives
                - Mitigate 6 Oct dump
                - Actively migrate users from SSS to Arbi & 'mainnet'
                - Reward early supporters
            - Redeemable 1:1.X for veMAGIC
            - What you get
                - Early access to beta environment on Arbi
                - [15%] additional veMAGIC
            - Process of migration
                - airdropped aMAGIC on arbi
                - User can select which timelock to apply at redemption (still thinking through min locking period - maybe 2 weeks or 1 month)
        - MAGIC LP
            - Boosted rewards for x weeks
        
    
    - veMAGIC
        - Objectives
            - Reward loyal users
            - Act as access key to Treasure / Magic ecosystem
        - Mechanics - Transmute and lock MAGIC for:
            - GENESIS
                - Required to power up the town which houses the path to the mine, marketplace etc --> need x% of MAGIC circ supply + x points of Treasure
                    - (prob use lower threshold so it turns on, but nice way to gamify, potentially could remove the treasure component
                - Required to power up (unlock) the Genesis Mine (x% of MAGIC circ supply must be staked at all times + x points of Treasure)
                - Expands GENESIS mine capacity --> if staked ve / CS reaches certain thresholds (and stays there), new mine capacity opens up (ie higher APR)
                - Grants a boost on mining productivity (and later treasure and legion farming) --> based on your relative share of staked ve to total --> need to confirm the math on this
            - access Seasonal features
                - modifiers based on Guild selected
                    - **Treasure hunters**: % boost on treasure farm productivity; higher chance of finding rare treasures in mines for alchemy (creating rarer legions)
                    - **Mercenaries** (legions): % boost on legion and or mining efficiency
                    - **Merchants:** % on selected mines or % of treasure farms or % of marketplace (the most passive strategy)
                - There is a [5%] fee from mining / farming related to each Guild's specialty. veMAGIC holders get % of this fee based on relative holdings
                - quests
                - aesthetics
                - rewards
                    - individual rewards
                    - group rewards (% of total locked for x epochs)
            - voting in a Community Treasure DAO?
            - partnership integrations / exclusive benefits
            - DeFi access key
                - Staking on marketplace
                    - NFT staking - stake X NFT in X pool, and receive your proportional share of 1.25% on sales of X NFT (25 / 75 based on X NFT and veMAGIC holding)
                - NFT / consumable yield farms
                    - Stake NFT on consumable farms to earn [x] on yield
                - Borrowing against your NFT
                    - use veMAGIC and NFT as collateral to borrow MAGIC (set your own params)
                    - lend MAGIC, consumables etc for variable IR (based on FUSE)
                - Lending NFTs
                    - Lend your legion - dont have time or skill to play / earn; just lend it and split earnings
                - Sell future yields on NFT / consumables for discount on face value
                - Scholarship - open bids for % share on your winnings and split earnings
                - Pool resources under mini DAO share earnings
            - How
                - Time lock dictates weighting (maybe change to round numbers for smooth brains)
                    - 1 month → 0.1
                    - 3 month → 0.35
                    - 6 month → 0.75
                    - 12 month → 1.75
                - Application
                    - relative veMAGIC holdings determine your share of:
                        - Guild yields (the 5% fee) across mining, legion, merchant
                        - Boost on your Guild's speciality (eg. you get higher mining efficiency)
                            - up to 3x boost determined by your relative share of veMAGIC in that guild (maybe quadratic to help shrimps)
                - Decay
                    - Decay of voting power on linear basis
                    - Does this impact yield boost?
                        - If yes, incentivises ppl to replenish
                - 
            - Mining
                - ALL mined MAGIC is vested:
                    - 30% immediately, linear over [4] weeks

                - **Mercenaries** (legions): % boost on legion and or mining efficiency
                - **Merchants:** % on selected mines or % of treasure farms or % of marketplace (the most passive strategy)

        - Ideologies (introduce in second season)
            - Selection of 2-3 ideologies at the start of each season
